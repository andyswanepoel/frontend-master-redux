# Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)

[Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/redux-fundamentals/) is a course offered through Frontend Masters by [Steve Kinney](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/steve-kinney/).

The course is split into a few parts, which I have added notes for in each section.

## Plain Old Redux

The course first teaches you about just the Redux library, you can find this in the [`vanilla-redux` folder](./vanilla-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./vanilla-redux//README.md) for notes that I took.
