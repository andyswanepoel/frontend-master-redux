# Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)

[Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/redux-fundamentals/) is a course offered through Frontend Masters by [Steve Kinney](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/steve-kinney/).

The course is split into a few parts, which I have added notes for in each section.

## Plain Old Redux

The course first teaches you about just the Redux library. You can find this in the [`vanilla-redux` folder](./01_vanilla-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./01_vanilla-redux/README.md) for notes that I took.

## Connecting Redux to React

Next we added Redux to a React project. You can find this in the [`react-with-redux` folder](./02_react-with-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./02_react-with-redux/README.md) for notes that I took.

## Using the Connect API and Higher Order Components

We used higher order components along with `connect`, `mapStateToProps`, and `matchDispatchToProps` to pass Redux state into presentational components. You can see the application in the [`react-with-redux-part-2` folder](./03_react-with-redux-part-2/).

See the [ReadMe](./03_react-with-redux-part-2/README.md) for notes that I took.

## Redux Toolkit

We used Redux Toolkit to simplify some of the boilerplate from Redux. You can see the application in the [`redux-toolkit` folder](./04_redux-toolkit/).

See the [ReadMe](./04_redux-toolkit/README.md) for notes that I took.

## Async Redux

We can use Redux Toolkit to simplify data fetching. You can see the some applications in the [`async-redux` folder](./05_async-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./05_async-redux/README.md) for notes that I took.
