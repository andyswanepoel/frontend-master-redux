# Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)

[Redux Fundamentals (feat. React)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/redux-fundamentals/) is a course offered through Frontend Masters by [Steve Kinney](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/steve-kinney/).

The course is split into a few parts, which I have added notes for in each section.

## Plain Old Redux

The course first teaches you about just the Redux library. You can find this in the [`vanilla-redux` folder](./01_vanilla-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./01_vanilla-redux/README.md) for notes that I took.

## Connecting Redux to React

Next we added Redux to a React project. You can find this in the [`react-with-redux` folder](./02_react-with-redux/).

See the [ReadMe](./02_react-with-redux/README.md) for notes that I took.
